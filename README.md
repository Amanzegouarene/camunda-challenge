<h3>
This project is a solution for a coding challenge designed by 
<a href="https://camunda.com/">Camunda</a>, witch consists of a Graph traversal exercise
</h3>

The first solution is a BFS traversal, it is not working in all cases, 
since BFS is used to respond the question "Is a path between 2 nodes exist ?".
To print a path between 2 nodes (the exercise purpose), a DFS is more convenient.

<h5>A set of commits will come in to refactor the code and improve the solution.</h5>
